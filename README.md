# SWS_Model
Slow Wave Sleep Model (2024)

Calculate SWS model analysis properties in a stroke dataset as in Idesis et al (2024).

These scripts use MATLAB. They were tested using MATLAB 2020a. They require additional instructions for model application (Integration with C++ code). For more information see Herzog, Rub√©n, et al. "Neural mass modelling for the masses: Democratising access to whole-brain biophysical modelling with fastdmf." BioRxiv (2022): 2022-04.

Installation and usage: Download and unzip the directory, open MATLAB, and then navigate to wherever you downloaded the files. You can run the script from within that directory.
